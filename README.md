# Hello there!

Names Joe, You probably found this domain from scaning the QRL at my stemfair board. $${\color{yellow}Great!!!}$$
In this domain/repository, it will contain the two main code required for the hand detection.

&nbsp;

If you see anything that the code could improve upon please write a comment!

&nbsp;

$${\color{red}REQUIREMENTS:}$$
&nbsp;

For the code to function you have to import and download somethings.
- install visual studio code and set the code language to python
- install arduino IDE on to your computer
- Copy and past the code for the assistance module and then run it
- Name the code:

<pre> Assistance_module </pre>  

cause the name have to be very specific so that the code which operates the whole things can refer to it 

- dont worry if there is a error, the purpose was to just open the terminal
  
- Go into your terminal.

  - The terminal is the giant rectangle at the bottom of your screen

- In terminal type:
  <pre>pip install mediapipe</pre>
  
   - this installs mediapipe
&nbsp;
- In terminal type:
  <pre> pip install opencv-python</pre>
  - this installs opencv
&nbsp;

- In terminal type:
  <pre>pip install pyfirmata2</pre>
